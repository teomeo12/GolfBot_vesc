I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to my thesis supervisor, Professor Gerard Lacey. His insightful advice, consistent guidance, and unwavering support were invaluable in navigating my progress throughout this project. His expertise helped shape the direction of this research, and I am deeply appreciative of his mentorship.

My thanks also go to James Petri for his generous technical assistance. His deep knowledge of the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) and practical help with the robot's configuration were instrumental in overcoming several significant technical hurdles.

I am also grateful to Cecil Ryan, who provided me with the invaluable opportunity to work as a software developer intern at his company. This professional experience enhanced my software development skills and offered crucial insights into teamwork and project management, which greatly benefited my approach to this thesis.

Finally, I wish to thank my family and friends for their encouragement and support throughout this journey.
