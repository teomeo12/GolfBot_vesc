Maintaining high-quality golf courses requires regular divot repairs, which is a slow, repetitive, and tiring job for maintenance workers. The GolfBot project proposes an autonomous robot to identify and fix divots on golf courses. The robot uses advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning, including a custom-trained object detection model for real-time divot detection and a 3D depth camera for measuring divot size accurately. By leveraging the latest hardware and software advancements, such as RTK GPS modules for precise positioning, the robot can operate independently, saving time and reducing maintenance costs. GolfBot's mechanical repair mechanism includes a solenoid-controlled hopper with a motor-screw mechanism for dispensing a sand-seed mixture and rubber brushes for uniform spreading. This project aims to create an easy-to-use robot that improves the quality and efficiency of golf course maintenance.
