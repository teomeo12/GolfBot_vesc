I hereby declare that this thesis is entirely my own work and has not been submitted for any other degree or professional qualification. All sources I have used or quoted have been indicated and acknowledged by means of complete references.

The work described herein was conducted as part of the Master of Science program at Maynooth University. The GolfBot project was developed using university resources and facilities. As such, any intellectual property arising from this project is subject to the policies of Maynooth University.

In line with Maynooth University's guidelines on academic integrity, I wish to acknowledge the use of Generative AI in the preparation of this thesis. Specifically, I used Google's Gemini language model for assistance with grammar, spelling, and rephrasing of sentences to improve clarity and readability, as permitted by university policy. The AI was used as a supportive tool, and all final content, analysis, and critical thinking remain my own original work.
